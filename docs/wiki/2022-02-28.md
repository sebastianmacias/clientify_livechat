# 2022-02-28: `user.username` must be free of spaces and lowercased.

Starting with the [go-starter-2022-02-28](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2022-02-28) release, all `user.username`s must be trimmed, lowercased and free of spaces. We can't provide an automation within your database to apply this migration.

Thus, here are the required steps to do this **manually** within your database.


## Sample `users`

```sql
-- Sample users table
SELECT
    id,
    username
FROM
    users;

-- Result:
-- id                                    username
-- 76a79a2b-fbd8-45a0-b35b-671a28a87acf  "user2@example.com "
-- d9c0dee9-239e-4323-979a-a5354d289627  " user 2@example.com"
-- f6ede5d8-e22a-4ca5-aa12-67821865a3e5  "uSSer1@example.com"
```

All the above sample usernames are considered garbage starting with this release.
**BEFORE** you do anything, you should check if you are able to update these usernames without producing collisions (two separate users, who would receive the same username).

## Find potential `username` collisions

```sql
-- Find whitespace/uppercase collisions in the username field.
-- "If we trim + lowercase the above usernames, will there be collisions with other / between usernames"
-- Returns the count, the valid username and all collisions.
-- NOTE: If this query does not yield any results, you should be safe to automatically rename all user.username, as there are no collisions
SELECT
    count(id),
    LOWER(REPLACE(username, ' ', '')) AS valid_username,
    jsonb_agg(jsonb_build_object(id, username)) AS collisions
FROM
    users
GROUP BY
    valid_username
HAVING
    count(id) > 1;

-- Result:
-- count  valid_username       collisions
-- 2      "user2@example.com"  [{"76a79a2b-fbd8-45a0-b35b-671a28a87acf": " user2@example.com"}, {"d9c0dee9-239e-4323-979a-a5354d289627": "user 2@example.com"}]
```

If you receive results (like we do, as seen above) - you'll need to make a decision what should happen with these usernames (e.g. if they are really the same user, delete one - or contact the user about this issue).

## Find affected `users` and print `UPDATE` statements

To find the lowercased and spaces free versions of **all affected users**, use the following:

```sql
-- Find whitespaces and uppercase letters in username field.
-- Returns the id, invalid (current) username, the new valid username and a sample query to manually execute the UPDATE.
-- 
-- NOTE: If you get duplicate key errors executing a returned update_query:
-- * you may have a whitespace/uppercase collision in the username
-- * check the query regarding collisions below
SELECT
    id,
    username AS invalid_username,
    LOWER(REPLACE(username, ' ', '')) AS valid_username,
    FORMAT('UPDATE users SET username = ''%s'' WHERE id = ''%s'';', LOWER(REPLACE(username, ' ', '')), id) AS update_query
FROM
    users
WHERE
    LOWER(REPLACE(username, ' ', '')) != username;

-- Result:
-- id                                    invalid_username       valid_username       update_query
-- 76a79a2b-fbd8-45a0-b35b-671a28a87acf  "user2@example.com "   "user2@example.com"  UPDATE users SET username = 'user2@example.com' WHERE id = '76a79a2b-fbd8-45a0-b35b-671a28a87acf';
-- d9c0dee9-239e-4323-979a-a5354d289627  " user 2@example.com"  "user2@example.com"  UPDATE users SET username = 'user2@example.com' WHERE id = 'd9c0dee9-239e-4323-979a-a5354d289627';
-- f6ede5d8-e22a-4ca5-aa12-67821865a3e5  "uSSer1@example.com"   "usser1@example.com" UPDATE users SET username = 'usser1@example.com' WHERE id = 'f6ede5d8-e22a-4ca5-aa12-67821865a3e5';
```

This will give you all the required `UPDATE` statements for proper usernames.
